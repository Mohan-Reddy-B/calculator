Software
  JDK(java development kit)
    -JDK consists of(JRE and JVM and complier)
  JRE(java runtime environment)
    -it provide some of the libraries
  JVM(java virtual machine)
    -load the file
    -verify the code
    -execute the code

Features:
 -simple
 -secure
 -high level
 -object oriented(diseaning an application in the form of class and object)
 -platform independent(you can write program in any operating system)
 -portable
 -dynamic
 -distributed(It consists of RMI(remot method imocation))
 -multithreading(exectuing multiple tasks in a single programming)
 -robust(strong)
         
variables:
         -contains to store a data
Types of variables:
         local variable
          -variables declared inside method
         instance
           -variable declared inside class and outside of method
         static
          -variable declared inside the class but declared with static variable

data types:
    CLASSIFICATION OF DATA ITEMS
     -there 2 types
        1)primitive data type(store single value)
           -int(4 byte)
           -byte(1 byte)
           -float(4 byte)
           -long(8 bite)
           -double(8 byte)
           -boolean(1 byte)
           -char(2 byte)
        2)non primitive data type(u can store multiple values)
          size can defined by programmer
           -string
           -array
           -class 
           -object
           -list , queue, stack

operators
   -symbols to perform operations between two operands
1.Arithmetic operators 
   +,-,*,%
2.Relational operator
  <,<=,>,>=,==,!=
3.Assignment operation
=
4.Logical operator 
  &&,||,!
5.Unary operator:
  ++,--
   -post increment
       int a=10;
           a++//10(the value will be 11)
           ++a//12
   -pre increment
6.ternary operator
  a>b?a:b

Conditional statements:(it is also called as decision making statement)
  1)if 
  2)if_else
  3)if else if
  4)nested if
  5)switch

Looping statements:
  iterate over number of sequence
-for loop
     (initialization;condition;increment)
ex:
 for(int i=1;i<=num;i++){
       factorial *=i;
}
num=5(how its work)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   i     factorial(before) factorial*=i(calculations)  factorial(after)
   1           1               1*1=1                        1
   2           1               1*2=2                        2
   3           2               2*3=6                        6
   4           6               6*4=24                       24
   5           24              24*5=120                     120
----------------------------------------------------------------------------   
-while loop
      entry controlled loop
-do while loop
      exit controlled loop

Jump statement:
 1.break
 2.continue

Array:
   -It is an object use to collection of homogenious elements of same data type
   -elements are stored in contigous memory location
   -arrays stored fixed elements and these are index based
   -index starts from zero

Disadvantage of an array:
   -size of an array is fixed so the size of the array does not grow dynamically at run time


Types of array
 1.single dimensional array
     -Collecting the values in linear data structure
 2.multi dimensional array
     -array of array
     -rows and columns
        0 1
       [2 4  0
        4 2] 1

create an array:
1)int ar[]//declaration 
2)int []ar=new int[5]//declaration and instantiation
3)int []ar={1,2,3,4}

oops:
   Object oriented programming language
   mainly used object to organize the code
   creating an application using class and object

Uses
  1.modularity
  2.re usability
  3.readability
  4.scalability
  5.flexibility

class:
   -collection of object
   -it is a blue print
   -user define protocol

Object:
 -Instance of class
 -without class con't create an object

two properties
1.sate
     -variable(what object knows)
     
2.behaveiour
     -method(what object does)

eg:
 pen

 2 ways to initialize data members
   *by using reference variable
   *by using method
   *by using constructor

Constructor:
   it is a method used to initialize the data members
   constructor name should be same as class name
   at the time of object creation 
   constructor gets called implicitly

Types of constructor
1.default constructor
2.parameterized constructor

This keyword:
  --The this keyword in Java is a reference variable that refers to the current 
    object of the class. It is used in different scenarios to avoid confusion
    between instance variables and parameters, invoke methods, and return the 
    current class instance.

4 properties / pillars of oops
1.Inheritance
    -aquring properties from one class to another class (or) base class to child class
     types of inheritance
     1.single level inheritance
          -one parent class and one child class
     2.multilevel
          -one parent class and multiple sub class
     3.hybrid 
          -single, multilevel,hierarch
     4.hierarchical
          -one parent class
          -multiple child class
     5.multiple
          -multiple parent class
          -child class
          -doesnot support using class
          -u can achive it an using an interface
2.abstraction
3.encapsulation
4.polymorphism
    -many forms
    -performing a method in a different ways
        2 types 
        1.run time polymorphism(method overriding)
           -2 classes (inheritance)
           -same method same parameter same return type
           -if child class has same method as declared in the parent class
        2.compile time polymorphism(method overloading)
           -same method but different parameters
3.Abstraction:
 -hiding implementation details and showing only the functionalities
 -using two ways
     -using abstract key word
     -using interface
when declaring a method you can use an abstract class
when method is abstract then class will become an abstract class 

4.Encapsulation
  -Wrapping up of variable and methods into a single unit
  1)getter
  2)setter

Achieve encapsulation
 -using an private key word

Interface
 -it is blue print
 -user defined protocol
 -same like class
 -it consists of all abstract method
 -no need to use abstract key word
 -from java 8 features it allows to add default and static method 
 -achieve 100% abstraction
 -to achieve multiple inheritance
 -you cant create object
 -implements(when acquires property from interface use implement)
 -when interface acquires from interface it is again extends     
 

JDBC(java database connectivity)
    -it is an API(application programming interface)
    -it consists set of rules to connect with different soft wares
    -it consists classes and interface
    -use jdbc drive
     
MySql: 
   -create a database name class training
   -create a table called user
   -create a column

to connect JDBC and MySql there are 7 steps
 1.import sql package
     -import java.sql.*;
 2.load the driver
     -Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
 3.establish the connection
     -Connection cn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost","root","null");
 4.create a statement
 5.execute statement   
     -executeUpdate();
 6.process the result
 7.close the connection
